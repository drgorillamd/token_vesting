#Token vesting Solidity

Coded for KimJongMoon - Nuke the Moon.

- Constructor parameters are the timestamp of the end of vesting period (in unix format, see unixtimestamp.com for instance) and the address of KimJongMoon token ($KIMJ), currently 0x737f0e47c4d4167a3eecde5fa87306b6eee3140e
- Contract set a "factor" to 2 -> half of the token are linearly vested until the end of the vesting period (the whole contract balance is withdrawable at expiration)

#Use
Deploy the contract on the same chain as the token (BSC in this case, but any EVM would do the trick)
Pass appropriate parameters to the constructor
Once deployed, send the token to the contract (ONLY the token passed as parameter of the constructor)
Call the start_vesting() function
Pending_token() returns the amount of token currently withdrawable
